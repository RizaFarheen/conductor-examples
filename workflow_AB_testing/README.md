# A/B Testing Workers

We have built 2 workflows that allow for A/B testing workers in your workflow.


* [A/B with switch task](https://github.com/conductor-sdk/conductor-examples/blob/main/workflow_AB_testing/AB_switch.json)
* [A/B with inline task](https://github.com/conductor-sdk/conductor-examples/blob/main/workflow_AB_testing/AB_inline.json)
